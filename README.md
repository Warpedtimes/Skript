# Skript 
Contains custom scripts I have written and released.
Most of them are pretty bad and could do with a rewrite (sheeeesh)

CF.sk: 
- A simple script for having coinflips between players

Jobs.sk: 
- A jobs script for your minecraft server! Includes 6 Jobs (Miner, Farmer, Hunter, Lumberjack, Excavator and Enchanter!) Players will be paid money for each action they do

Mentions.sk
 - Skript for highlighing mentioned players in chat.

AntiBuild
 - Toggle building. Useful for playing around as OP and not wanting to break blocks.
